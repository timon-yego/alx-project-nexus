# Project Nexus Documentation

## **Project Objective**
This repository serves as a documentation hub for my major learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering** program. It showcases my understanding of backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices acquired throughout the program.

## **My Learning Experience**

### **Key Technologies Covered**
Throughout the program, I worked extensively with the following technologies:
- **Python** – Used for backend development, scripting, and automation.
- **Django** – Built robust web applications using Django’s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
- **REST APIs** – Designed and implemented RESTful APIs for data exchange.
- **GraphQL** – Explored GraphQL’s flexibility in handling complex queries and data fetching.
- **Docker** – Containerized applications to ensure portability and consistency.
- **CI/CD** – Automated deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.

### **Important Backend Development Concepts**
- **Database Design** – Implemented relational databases with MySQL, focused on normalization and indexing for performance optimization.
- **Asynchronous Programming** – Used Celery and RabbitMQ to handle background tasks efficiently.
- **Caching Strategies** – Integrated Redis for caching to optimize API response times.

### **Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented**
- **Handling API Performance Issues:** Optimized queries using `select_related` and `prefetch_related` in Django ORM.
- **Ensuring Secure API Endpoints:** Implemented authentication using JWT and environment-based secret management.
- **Managing Background Tasks:** Integrated Celery with RabbitMQ to handle email notifications asynchronously.
- **Deploying Applications:** Faced initial issues with Docker networking but resolved them by configuring `docker-compose` properly.
- **Time Management Issues:** Initially, I underestimated the complexity of certain tasks, assuming they would be easy and not allocating enough time for them. This led to rushed implementations and debugging challenges. I resolved this by breaking down tasks into smaller milestones, estimating required effort more accurately, and setting buffer time for unexpected issues.

### **Best Practices & Personal Takeaways**
- **Write Clean & Maintainable Code** – Adhered to standards and followed Django best practices.
- **Use Environment Variables** – Avoided hardcoding secrets by managing configurations securely.
- **Test APIs Thoroughly** – Used Django’s built-in test framework and Postman to validate API functionality.
- **Document Everything** – Maintained clear API documentation using `drf-yasg` for Swagger integration.
- **Manage Time Effectively** – Scheduled coding sessions, set clear goals, and used time management tools like Trello to track progress.
- **Adopt a Growth Mindset** – Embraced challenges as learning opportunities, stayed persistent through debugging, and continuously sought to improve skills.
- **Collaboration & Communication** - Engaged in active discussions on Discord and peer reviews.
